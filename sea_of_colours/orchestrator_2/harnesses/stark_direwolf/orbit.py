"""Orbit submission — the fleet-recovery gate over the seat's buying policy.

The buying policy itself lives in :mod:`.orbit_policy` and is **fork-local**
(v1.40): each agent owns what it spends credits and BLUE on. This module is
the submission path plus one gate that sits on top of it.

The gate (R4): v9's audit found v10-lineage seats ran a whole 7-night season
on 1–2 harvesters (the mirror ran on ONE). The buying policy only builds a
harvester once credits clear the full 1500c target — so after a harvester
dies, or early when the seat is still on one unit, credits get nibbled by
speculative probe builds and the fleet never recovers. A single harvester
caps banked RED hard.

So ONLY in the fleet-short window (day ≤4 on a single harvester, or a
harvester died last night) this trims probe builds back to a hot-drop floor
and either injects the recovery harvester when it is affordable this turn or
conserves the freed credits toward it next turn. It NEVER fabricates an
unaffordable build (the engine charges the real cost at resolution) and NEVER
drops below the probe floor the multiprobe doctrine needs.

Hermetic: only this fork's orbit path calls it; v6/v7/v8/v9 are untouched.
