"""``soc`` — the one command for the hackathon.

    python scripts/soc.py new --team redwatch --name reaper
    python scripts/soc.py lab
    python scripts/soc.py season --p1 redwatch_reaper --p2 tabula_v12

There is deliberately one entry point. The kit has a fair amount behind
it — a scenario suite, a fork minter, a submission path, a league — and
discovering four separate scripts is four chances to not find the third
one. ``soc`` with no arguments lists everything it can do.

**Written to be driven by an agent.** Most attendees will be improving
their agent through a coding assistant rather than by hand, so the
assistant is a first-class user of this CLI. That means: every error
names the fix, every subcommand explains what it is for in ``--help``,
and output is plain text an LLM can read back without parsing tricks.
``--json`` is there for when it wants structure instead.
